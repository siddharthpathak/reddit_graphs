My uncle and his partner arrive on the scene and enter the apartment, weapons drawn (standard protocol for a possible shooting in progress). Right in the entry way is (what's left) of a middle aged Italian gentlemen who apparently made the decision to end his life by shooting himself in the head with a 45 revolver. He's obviously dead. According to my uncle his face was basically blown in half. Nose missing, one eye gone and the other hanging from what's left of the socket. My uncles partner goes out to the squad car to radio for the cleanup crew (the guys that come and scoop up the dead guy). My uncle stands at the door making sure no one enters the apartment until they arrive. About 5 minutes pass and my uncle hears what sounds like something moving inside the apartment. He figures the guy probably has a cat or a dog (your pet will eat you if you die and they are hungry btw) so he heads back in to shoo it away so it doesn't further damage the guys body.

My uncle and his partner arrive on the scene and enter the apartment, weapons drawn (standard protocol for a possible shooting in progress). Right in the entry way is (what&amp;#39;s left) of a middle aged Italian gentlemen who apparently made the decision to end his life by shooting himself in the head with a 45 revolver. He&amp;#39;s obviously dead. According to my uncle his face was basically blown in half. Nose missing, one eye gone and the other hanging from what&amp;#39;s left of the socket. My uncles partner goes out to the squad car to radio for the cleanup crew (the guys that come and scoop up the dead guy). My uncle stands at the door making sure no one enters the apartment until they arrive. About 5 minutes pass and my uncle hears what sounds like something moving inside the apartment. He figures the guy probably has a cat or a dog (your pet will eat you if you die and they are hungry btw) so he heads back in to shoo it away so it doesn&amp;#39;t further damage the guys body.

We were waiting at a light right as we were headed back to the station for our end of shift. We see a man running like usain bolt across the crosswalk to beat the light and a woman chasing him. My partner and I both look at eachother and he says \u201cshe\u2019s gonna get hit...\u201d sure as shit the car in the rightmost lane guns it as the light turns green and the next thing we see is flip flops flying and a pair of legs in the air. Female was plowed over and landed on her face in the street. We immediately turn on our lights and hop out of the ambulance. When we get to the girl she\u2019s unconscious, pissed herself, and is bleeding from multiple lacerations on her limbs and a nasty head wound. My partner (who is a paramedic) starts his assessment as I go to grab a backboard and c-collar and call it into dispatch. She wakes up and immediately starts screaming about her boyfriend leaving her. She stands up and tries to run after him, faceplants on the curb, and proceeds to lose a tooth. We finally calmed her down enough to get her onto the gurney, mind you she wouldn\u2019t listen and kept trying to walk around after suffering a couple head injuries. Once we get her into the back of the ambulance and out of the road into a nearby parking lot the driver that hit her rolls up. By now firefighters are on scene and asking what the hell is going on, we give them the lowdown and my partner tells them we can handle it so they leave, confused and somewhat trepidatious. We talk to this women for a while while insisting that she needs to go the hospital, but she keeps saying that she can\u2019t go and she needs to find her boyfriend. Meanwhile the driver who hit her is apologizing to me and saying she wants to help anyway she can. The woman keeps saying she can\u2019t go the hospital. After we got her cleaned up and bandage all the wounds she asks if we can take her to her boyfriends house. Well as an EMT I can do one of 2 things, either take you to the hospital or leave you where you are. She refuses transport vehemently so my partner and I tell her that we can\u2019t take her anywhere. She then proceeds to hop out of the ambulance and ask the driver who just hit her if she would take her to her boyfriends house if she didn\u2019t call the cops.

We were waiting at a light right as we were headed back to the station for our end of shift. We see a man running like usain bolt across the crosswalk to beat the light and a woman chasing him. My partner and I both look at eachother and he says \u201cshe\u2019s gonna get hit...\u201d sure as shit the car in the rightmost lane guns it as the light turns green and the next thing we see is flip flops flying and a pair of legs in the air. Female was plowed over and landed on her face in the street. We immediately turn on our lights and hop out of the ambulance. When we get to the girl she\u2019s unconscious, pissed herself, and is bleeding from multiple lacerations on her limbs and a nasty head wound. My partner (who is a paramedic) starts his assessment as I go to grab a backboard and c-collar and call it into dispatch. She wakes up and immediately starts screaming about her boyfriend leaving her. She stands up and tries to run after him, faceplants on the curb, and proceeds to lose a tooth. We finally calmed her down enough to get her onto the gurney, mind you she wouldn\u2019t listen and kept trying to walk around after suffering a couple head injuries. Once we get her into the back of the ambulance and out of the road into a nearby parking lot the driver that hit her rolls up. By now firefighters are on scene and asking what the hell is going on, we give them the lowdown and my partner tells them we can handle it so they leave, confused and somewhat trepidatious. We talk to this women for a while while insisting that she needs to go the hospital, but she keeps saying that she can\u2019t go and she needs to find her boyfriend. Meanwhile the driver who hit her is apologizing to me and saying she wants to help anyway she can. The woman keeps saying she can\u2019t go the hospital. After we got her cleaned up and bandage all the wounds she asks if we can take her to her boyfriends house. Well as an EMT I can do one of 2 things, either take you to the hospital or leave you where you are. She refuses transport vehemently so my partner and I tell her that we can\u2019t take her anywhere. She then proceeds to hop out of the ambulance and ask the driver who just hit her if she would take her to her boyfriends house if she didn\u2019t call the cops.

I politely let them know that they're grown adults and, while the law says that they have to wear their seatbelts, they're grown adults and I'm willing to let that slide, but they will be receiving a ticket for not restraining the child. \n\nI was sitting in my patrol unit, sitting there writing the ticket, when I see someone approaching me. I roll the window down, expecting to get an earful about why are we always harassing people. Instead, the move young lady screams at me, \"Are you going to do something about that?!\" and points at a large tree a half a block away. I look at her, summon every ounce of restraint I have, and calmly ask, \"The tree?\" \"No, behind it.\" 1, 2, 3... deep breath.  \"Ma'am, I can't see through the tree, what's the problem?\" \"He's choking her!\"\n\nI get out the car and start approaching the tree, telling the driver of the car I stopped to stay there or I'll get a warrant for his arrest on the traffic charge and resisting. As I approach the tree, I swing out wide and see, sure as hell, there's a dude choking the absolute shit out of some chick. I call for additional officers, draw my weapon, and order the guy to let her go. He does and she runs off. Dude starts calmly walking away. I tell him to stop, he doesn't, so I holster my weapon, grab him, do an arm bar takedown, and put him in cuffs. I radio headquarters and tell them I've got one in custody. \n\nAs I'm walking him back to my unit, he suddenly twists around and tries to bite me in the face. Now, I'm a big guy (6'4\") and having someone try jump at you and try to bite your face will result in an immediate reaction. Mine was twofold. I leaned back and to the side and I also pushed his head straight down as hard and fast as I could.

While I was defending myself from an attack, I don't expect them to care about me and my safety nearly so much as the fact that I just tossed their neighbor on the ground while he was in handcuffs. I was surprised. The first person to speak up was an older woman whose house I've been to multiple times to arrest her son. That was a good thing, because that meant she knew me and people who know me, even people who know me from an adversarial standpoint, tend to like me and trust me because I'm always fair with everyone I deal with. She said, loudly, \"Baby, I don't know why he didn't listen to you and avoid all that foolishness.\" I was able to actually watch the hostility drain from the faces of many in the crowd. I commented on how unnecessary the whole thing was and asked if anyone knew where the victim went. I immediately got a volunteer to go get her. \n\n\nWhen the victim got there, I see that, in addition to bruises on her neck from the strangulation, she's got a black eye and a brush burn on her forehead.

No one helped her, no one called the cops, and the one who notified me waited a good five minutes to do so. \n\nThe driver of the car I pulled over got out and asked me if he could go. I said no.
