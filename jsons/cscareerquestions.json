At that point you would expect them to at least have let you know after the interview that they had a lot more candidates to get through and it might take a few months, or reply to your emails asking how they were doing with the recruiting process for the position you applied for.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But hey, if the additional $20k salary makes up for the fact that you were obviously not their first choice (and probably not their second or third either: those 4 months were probably spent with other people starting and washing out during probation or them going down the list making offers) and that getting anything done at the company might take forever (or you might not even make it through the probation if those 4 months really was everyone else washing out), then you do you! Personally I would probably stick with the company that I was already working for and was much more on-the-ball with their hiring process, especially if the salary I already have is a fair salary for the area.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR If the increase in pay outweighs the red flags of them taking 4 months to get back to you, that&amp;#39;s your choice.
